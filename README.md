# assignment2

Yet another challenging assignment. I feel like there is a disconnect between what I need to do and what I know how to do. It all comes with practice, which I do do, but I do have to admit that there were many times during this assignment that I just simply had to walk away.

The idea itself I understand, I am aware of what is required, but it's the placement of the code and my own courage to make a mistake and start over if needed (which I did, several times). This is what I've been able to acheive. This is not something that I am proud of, but it's better than an empty submission.

I find bootstrap intersting and quite amazing, the idea of a CDN and it's time saving properties is borderline miraculous, manipulating inside that pre-defined code with losing the capabilities of the components and features is where I felt the majority of my frustration. I am not used to submitting in this kind of work. 

I am presenting what I have, which represents five days worth or worry and heartache. My images stopped working at the eleventh hour and I, quite frankyl, am at the end of my rope with this assignment. At the very least it's responsive.
