# assignment2

Another challenging assignment. I feel like there is a disconnect between what I need to do and what I know how to do. It all comes with practice, which I do do, but I do have to admit that there were many times during this assignment that I just simply had to walk away.

The idea itself I understand, I am aware of what is required, but it's the placement of the code and my own courage to make a mistake and start over if needed (which I did, several times). This is what I've been able to acheive.

I find bootstrap intersting and quite amazing, the idea of a CDN and it's time saving properties is borderline miraculous, manipulating inside that pre-defined code with losing the capabilities of the components and features is where I felt the majority of my frustration. I am not used to submitting in this kind of work. 

I am presenting what I have, which represents five days worth or worry and heartache. My images posed a challenge until I discovered through a Google search that a relative file path should be selected. I am just not getting this....
